    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Nickola'
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    
    // now here is the problem!
    // console.log(players, team)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    // const team2 = players.slice()
    // team2[2] = 'Ninny'
    // console.log(players, team2)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // const team2 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
      // const team2 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      // team2[3] = 'Ninny'
      // console.log(players, team2)

    // with Objects

    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person
    // person.age = 101
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'harry', age: 101})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain = {...person}
    captain['age'] = 909
    console.log(person, captain)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
